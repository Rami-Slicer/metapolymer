## Metapolymer

Metapolymer is a Minecraft mod made for the Fabric modloader that allows textures for items and entities to change based off of the resources packs you have loaded. The person who owns the named item does **NOT** need to have this mod or a compatible resource pack but you do need both to see the custom texture for their item.
